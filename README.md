# CSSedit #

CSS editor for [Vanilla](https://github.com/vanilla/vanilla).

Using this plugin, you can add additional CSS rules to your current theme through an [Ace](http://ace.c9.io/)-enhanced editor in the Garden Dashboard. Stylesheets are minified and cached, LESS and SCSS can be compiled too.

Ideas for future versions:
* Seperate styles for desktop/mobile
* Preview mode
* better revision management (named revisions, saving, ...)
