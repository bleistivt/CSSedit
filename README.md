# CSSedit #

CSS editor for [Vanilla](https://github.com/vanilla/vanilla).

Using this plugin, you can add additional CSS rules to your current theme through an [Ace](http://ace.c9.io/)-enhanced editor in the Garden Dashboard. Stylesheets are minified and cached, LESS can be compiled too.

Ideas for future versions / todo:
* Test in 2.0.18 (should work, only tested in 2.1 though)
* Properly comment everything
* Seperate styles for desktop/mobile
* More preprocessors
* ~~Backup~~
* Preview mode
